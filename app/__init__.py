Personal Finance Assistant API Package

This package implements a FastAPI application demonstrating Strands Agents
with memory integration, following Lab 2 from the Strands Agents samples.

The application showcases:
- Short-term memory (conversation history, agent state, request state)
- Long-term memory (mem0.io integration)
- AWS Bedrock integration (Claude 3.7 Sonnet)
- RESTful API for agent interactions
